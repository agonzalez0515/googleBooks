## Summary

This project uses Google Books API to display 10 search results of books matching a term. 

I used React, Sass with CSS Modules, and React Testing Library.

Images are from [Undraw](https://undraw.co/).

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) and deployed to [Netlify](https://netlify.com).
